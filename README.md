# Smart Electricity Consumption Monitoring System
## Introduction
This project, conducted as part of the Internet of Things course in the Spring semester of 2021, focuses on the development of an online system for monitoring electricity consumption.

## Overview
* The project consists of 7 main sections that cover different aspects of the system:
### Introduction

Overview of the system and its objectives.

### System Overview

* Detailed description of the system, its components, and functionality.

### Data Types and Applications

Overview of the data used in the system and various potential applications.

### Urban Network
The urban network section consists of three main subtopics:

* Communication Technology: This project utilizes LoRa technology, with NB-IoT as a backup system. The reasons for selecting each of these technologies are explained.

* Network Data: Details on the types of data transferred over the network.

* Network Architecture: The network is designed as a mesh, with one of the key reasons for this being the structure of the network data.

### Home Network

* This section explores the implementation of the system within a home network and discusses the related challenges.

### Urban Energy Consumption Data Analysis

This section provides a detailed analysis of energy consumption data, divided into two subtopics:

* Impact of Age and Building Size: How factors like age and building size affect energy consumption.

* Data Variations: A comparison of data from different sources and its impact on the system.

### Conclusion

The final section summarizes the findings and outcomes of the project, highlighting the key takeaways.
